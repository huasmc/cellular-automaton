## Cellular Automaton Model

This small program consists of a grid board with a finite number of cells where each cell has a state. The state of each cell depends on the state of the neighbour cells.

The rules used to set the state of each cell come from the cellular automaton created by John Horton Conway.

The program has 4 classes:

- Board
- BoardGenerator
- CellChecker
- Main
- BoardDisplay

## Requirements

- Java
- Intellij IDE (Optional)

## How to run

- Clone this repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/huasmc/cellular-automaton
```

- Get inside src folder `cd src`

- Compile the project `javac com/company/*.java`

- Run the project `java com/company`

Or run from IDE: 

- Open in your preferred IDE.

- Play.


## Things to be added/improved

- Unit Testing.

- GUI.

- Optimize code.

- The automaton could be more complex and less limited by the dimension of the 2d array.
